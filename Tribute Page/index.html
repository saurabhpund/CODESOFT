              Vallabhbhai Patel (31 October 1875 â€“ 15 December 1950), popularly
              known as Sardar Patel, was an Indian politician who served as the
              first Deputy Prime Minister of India. He was an Indian barrister
              and statesman, a senior leader of the Indian National Congress and
              a founding father of the Republic of India who played a leading
              role in the country's struggle for independence and guided its
              integration into a united, independent nation.In India and
              elsewhere, he was often called Saprdar, Chief in Hindi, Urdu, and
              Persian. He acted as de facto Commander-in-chief of the Indian
              army during the political integration of India and the
              Indo-Pakistani War of 1947.

              against the British Raj, becoming one of the most influential
              leaders in Gujarat. He rose to the leadership of the Indian
              National Congress, organising the party for elections in 1934 and
              1937 while promoting the Quit India Movement.
